Y U NO SI?!
===========

## What is this?

This is a Chrome extension that converts imperial units to metric. Browse like
you always do, and when you find yourself in _that_ part of the Internet again,
proper units are two easy clicks away.

## Installing

Just head to [Chrome
store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/y-u-no-si/hmmkmklkdfmocajnanplbjmpajjjhhob)
and click through.

## Developer's build

You will need [node](http://nodejs.org/) to run tests. `sudo npm install -g
grunt-cli`, `npm install` and you're ready to `grunt` to run tests once or
`grunt watch` to run them continuously.
